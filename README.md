# Project-4-Push-Swap

Push Swap is our first introduction into algohoritms. 
A list if numbers must be sorted with a few limitations: stack a (including the ints) and 
stack b (an empty stack) must be used, with only a few amount of movements possible.

The goal is to sort the stack with the lowest possible number of operations. During
the evaluation process, the number of instructions found by the program will be
compared against a limit: the maximum number of operations tolerated.

Compile the program and make it work by ./push_swap 2 1 3 6 5 8 (more numbers may be included, also negatives)
